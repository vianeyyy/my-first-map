## About This Project
["My Interactive Map"]() is an interactive web map showcasing locations I've visited throughout the Bay Area. Using custom markers and detailed popups, this map serves as both a personal travel journal and an educational resource for anyone interested in web mapping technologies.

## Live Demo

## Project Purpose
This map was created to:
- Document and share my personal travel experiences visually
- Demonstrate practical applications of interactive web mapping
- Provide open-source code that others can learn from and adapt
- Combine technical development with personal storytelling

## Technical Implementation
Built with modern web technologies:
- **Mapping**: [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides) for interactive cartography
- **Data Structure**: GeoJSON for organizing location information
- **Development**: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with Live Server extension
- **Hosting**: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for public accessibility
- **Design**: Custom color scheme and visual styling

## Interactive Features

*This event handler creates smooth cursor interactions, changing to a pointer when hovering over map markers and reverting when moving away*

The map includes several interactive elements:
- Clickable markers with detailed information popups
- Custom images and descriptions for each location
- Responsive cursor changes on hover
- Smooth zoom and pan navigation

## Open Source Collaboration
This project welcomes community involvement! Special acknowledgment to **@domlet** for the original repository that inspired this work. I encourage developers to:
- Report issues or suggest enhancements
- Adapt the code for your own mapping projects
- Create versions highlighting different regions or themes
- Improve the documentation and examples
